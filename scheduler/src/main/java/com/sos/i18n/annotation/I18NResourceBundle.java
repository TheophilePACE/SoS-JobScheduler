 * messages whose annotations do not define a locale attribute. This default locale is only applicable for those
 * {@link I18NMessage} annotations within the same scope of this resource bundle annotation (that is, the default
 * is only for the class or field that this annotation annotates). If the default locale is not specified, the
 * annotation processor should choose an appropriate default (such as the default locale of the JVM).
